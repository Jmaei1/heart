                        A whole year 365 days of love, laughter, and yes, our fair share of misunderstandings too. Who would have thought that meeting in such an unexpected way would lead to something this deep, this real? I never imagined that someone miles away could make such a big impact on my heart, but here we are, proving that distance means nothing when love is real.  
                        
                        LDR isnâ€™t easy there are moments when it truly tests my patience (and you know that all too well ðŸ¤¡), but through every challenge, every late-night call, and every little moment in between, I still choose you. Every. Single. Day. Because itâ€™s you, Aman.  
                        
                        I just need to know that weâ€™re truly in this together, that itâ€™s not just words but actions too. And deep down, I believe in us. I believe in the love weâ€™ve built, the memories weâ€™ve made, and the future weâ€™re slowly creating. I love you soooo much, and I never want to doubt what we have. So letâ€™s keep proving that this love is worth every second, every challenge, every mile between us.  
                        
                        One year down, forever to go. ðŸ©·âœ¨</p>

                    <h1></h1>
                    <p>Hey my Amankot, ðŸ’–</p>
                    <p>I canâ€™t believe it's already been a 1year since we first started talking! Time has flown by so quickly, but at the same time, it feels like I've known you forever. Every day with you is so special, and I just want you to know how much I appreciate you. You really are the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. ðŸ¥°</p>
                    <p>I know Iâ€™m not always the easiest person to deal with, especially when I let my emotions get the best of me. ðŸ˜” Iâ€™ve had my moments, whether it's throwing tantrums or saying things I didnâ€™t mean, and Iâ€™m so sorry for that. I hate when I act that way, and I never want to hurt you. You deserve so much better than that, and I hope you know how much I regret it. Please know that itâ€™s never about you; itâ€™s just me being in my feelings sometimes. ðŸ˜¥ But Iâ€™ll work on it. Iâ€™m trying to be better for both of us. ðŸ’ª</p>
                    <p>You always show me so much patience and kindness, even when I donâ€™t deserve it, and that just makes me love you even more. ðŸ’• I really admire how you stay calm and understanding, even when Iâ€™m being all over the place. You always know how to make me feel better, and I canâ€™t thank you enough for that. You make everything feel easier and lighter, just by being yourself. ðŸŒŸ</p>
                    <p>I canâ€™t imagine going through this year without you by my side. Youâ€™re my person, the one I can talk to about anything, laugh with until my stomach hurts, and share my dreams and worries with. I feel so safe with you, and thatâ€™s something I never want to lose. You make me feel loved in a way that no one else ever has, and I truly hope Iâ€™m doing the same for you. ðŸ˜˜</p>
                    <p>I know itâ€™s not always easy with the distance between us, but every day Iâ€™m reminded of how strong our connection is. We might not be in the same place physically, but youâ€™re always in my heart. ðŸ’– And thatâ€™s something I wouldnâ€™t trade for anything. You make me believe that distance really doesnâ€™t matter when two people love each other as much as we do. ðŸ’Œ</p>
                    <p>I canâ€™t wait for the future, for all the little moments and big adventures weâ€™ll have together. Whether itâ€™s texting each other in the middle of the night or sharing a simple moment of silence, I cherish it all. Iâ€™m so proud of what weâ€™ve built, and I know weâ€™ll keep growing and making amazing memories together. ðŸ¥°</p>
                    <p>Thank you for being my rock, my best friend, my love. You make everything feel brighter, and I canâ€™t wait to see what the next 9 months (and beyond) hold for us. I love you more than I can even express, and Iâ€™m so thankful for you every single day. ðŸ’–</p>
                    <p>Forever and always</p>

                    <p>Roots Across the Distance</p>
                    <p>Amankot, you are like a tree,</p>
                    <p>Grown strong, yet still, you lean to me,</p>
                    <p>From roots that stretch through time and space,</p>
                    <p>You bloom in my heart, a steady grace.</p>
                    <p>Your branches reach out, though far you stand,</p>
                    <p>Yet I can feel your gentle hand,</p>
                    <p>A touch that nurtures, calm and kind,</p>
                    <p>Even when the worldâ€™s unkind.</p>
                    <p>You are the sapling in my dreams,</p>
                    <p>Planted where the sunlight gleams,</p>
                    <p>And though weâ€™re miles apart, you grow,</p>
                    <p>Through every word, through every glow.</p>
                    <p>Like leaves that rustle in the breeze,</p>
                    <p>Your love whispers through the trees,</p>
                    <p>A tender murmur, soft and pure,</p>
                    <p>That reassures my heart is sure.</p>
                    <p>The storms may come, the winds may howl,</p>
                    <p>But like a tree, you donâ€™t just bowâ€”</p>
                    <p>You stand, you sway, you bend but hold,</p>
                    <p>A steadfast strength in shades of gold.</p>
                    <p>Your roots, though buried deep in earth,</p>
                    <p>Stretch to me, and bring me mirth,</p>
                    <p>For in each whispered, quiet prayer,</p>
                    <p>I know you're waiting, always there.</p>
                    <p>The seasons change, the world may spin,</p>
                    <p>But in my heart, youâ€™ll always win,</p>
                    <p>For every leaf that falls away,</p>
                    <p>Another blooms to light our way.</p>
                    <p>And when the winter winds may freeze,</p>
                    <p>Iâ€™ll carry you within the trees,</p>
                    <p>Your warmth will always find its way,</p>
                    <p>To thaw my heart on coldest days.</p>
                    <p>Amankot, my love, though skies divide,</p>
                    <p>Youâ€™re like the plant that cannot hideâ€”</p>
                    <p>Your beauty shines through every hour,</p>
                    <p>A steady, constant, blooming flower.</p>
                    <p>The distance fades, the years may pass,</p>
                    <p>But like a tree, weâ€™ll always last,</p>
                    <p>For love, like roots, will deeply grow,</p>
                    <p>In every storm, through every glow.</p>
