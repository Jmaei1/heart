          <p>Hey my Amankot, ðŸ’–</p>
          <p>I canâ€™t believe it's already been 9 months since we first started talking! Time has flown by so quickly, but at the same time, it feels like I've known you forever. Every day with you is so special, and I just want you to know how much I appreciate you. You really are the best thing thatâ€™s ever happened to me, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. ðŸ¥°</p>
          <p>I know Iâ€™m not always the easiest person to deal with, especially when I let my emotions get the best of me. ðŸ˜” Iâ€™ve had my moments, whether it's throwing tantrums or saying things I didnâ€™t mean, and Iâ€™m so sorry for that. I hate when I act that way, and I never want to hurt you. You deserve so much better than that, and I hope you know how much I regret it. Please know that itâ€™s never about you; itâ€™s just me being in my feelings sometimes. ðŸ˜¥ But Iâ€™ll work on it. Iâ€™m trying to be better for both of us. ðŸ’ª</p>
          <p>You always show me so much patience and kindness, even when I donâ€™t deserve it, and that just makes me love you even more. ðŸ’• I really admire how you stay calm and understanding, even when Iâ€™m being all over the place. You always know how to make me feel better, and I canâ€™t thank you enough for that. You make everything feel easier and lighter, just by being yourself. ðŸŒŸ</p>
          <p>I canâ€™t imagine going through this year without you by my side. Youâ€™re my person, the one I can talk to about anything, laugh with until my stomach hurts, and share my dreams and worries with. I feel so safe with you, and thatâ€™s something I never want to lose. You make me feel loved in a way that no one else ever has, and I truly hope Iâ€™m doing the same for you. ðŸ˜˜</p>
          <p>I know itâ€™s not always easy with the distance between us, but every day Iâ€™m reminded of how strong our connection is. We might not be in the same place physically, but youâ€™re always in my heart. ðŸ’– And thatâ€™s something I wouldnâ€™t trade for anything. You make me believe that distance really doesnâ€™t matter when two people love each other as much as we do. ðŸ’Œ</p>
          <p>I canâ€™t wait for the future, for all the little moments and big adventures weâ€™ll have together. Whether itâ€™s texting each other in the middle of the night or sharing a simple moment of silence, I cherish it all. Iâ€™m so proud of what weâ€™ve built, and I know weâ€™ll keep growing and making amazing memories together. ðŸ¥°</p>
          <p>Thank you for being my rock, my best friend, my love. You make everything feel brighter, and I canâ€™t wait to see what the next 9 months (and beyond) hold for us. I love you more than I can even express, and Iâ€™m so thankful for you every single day. ðŸ’–</p>
          <p>Forever and always</p>
        </div>
